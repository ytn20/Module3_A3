# PyPoll with Python

## Overview of Election Audit

### Purpose

The purpose of this assignment was to analyze election results for Seth and Tom's election audit. By using the Python program to analyze the election results data
we are able to uncover some key findings such as voter turnout, perecentage of voters from each county, and the highest turnout from each county. 
This information can help auditos like Seth and Tom for current and future election campaigns.

## Election-Audit Summary
    - This script is very useful while analyzing future elections. It can be modified to be used for any election in the future. 
      A few changes that can be made to the script if it's to be used for future elections are as follows: 
        - Change the csv file that needs to be uploaded to the python script. In this analysis the "election_results.csv" file was used
        but for future elections a new file would need to be uploaded to the script.
        - Change the txt file where the edits are saved from the python script. In this analysis the changes were saved to
        "election_results.txt" file but for future elections the changes would need to be saved to another text file to avoid
        any confusion while analyzing the data
